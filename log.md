# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've finally decided to commit to commits on Github. I logged my first day on FreeCodeCamp on Jan 1, 2018, however, it is long past due of writing it all down.

Day 1: February 21, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Completed a portfolio I can be proud of, successfully got my weather app to change backgrounds by using the weather descriptions and a flickr API, got my tail handed to me on CodeClash, and dove into recursion on KhanAcademy
  (it's winter break :)
  - Thoughts: I struggle with mathy CS principles that are new and  with getting CSS to do what I want. I think I will do CodingGame CodeClash everyday in order to hone my skillz. I'm so happy I got my weather app finished!!

 Day 2: February 22, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Actually finished a CodeClash! a simple if/then counter. Learned about merge sorting with Khan, started the wiki viewer project, spent some time on w3schools.com learning about forms, found movethewebforward.com, starting to dive into jquery with learn.jquery.com, finally decided I should write all this down so I forked 100daysofcode, learning how to use github
  - Thoughts: Khan is killin' me, but it is good to know the upper bounds of my CS limits, apparently w3schools.com sucks and is a scam so need to move on from them, learn.jquery.com looks promising, github is really confusing for the time being. 

 Day 3: February 23, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Worked through Khan's Quicksort Algorithms, lost a CodingClash about summing powers..., tried to get momentum on the FCC wiki viewer project, read ch. 1 and 2 of Clean Code
  - Thoughts: Khan is still over my head but it feels like good exposure, I need to give the wiki viewer a break till i understand more of what is going on for json/ajax
  
 Day 4: Feb 24, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Worked through MDN's HTML tuts and finished with their markup assessment.
  - Thoughts: I would like to make it through MDN's tuts, plus it is nice to feel like my practice is paying off... 
  - Link to Work: https://github.com/mckelveygreg/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/marking-up-a-letter-start/letter-text.html
 
 Day 5: Feb 25, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Was able to do some work on SoloLearn's CSS tuts on a road trip up from Eugene.
  - Thoughts: Thank goodness for SoloLearn! They have really helped when I've been up a creek without access to my laptop!
 
 Day 6: Feb 26, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Loaded a bunch of plugin's to Visual Studio. Finished MDN's HTML with their Structuring a Page TUT. Also, had to retype the last few days because I forgot to save this log... :/
  - Thoughts: I'm liking working from a real IDE instead of doing everything just through codepen, despite it being so handy. I need to learn how to post my own stuff!

 Day 7: Feb 27, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Made it through MDN's multimedia and embeding tuts, just need to do the assesement.
  - Thoughts: I really hope this is time well spent. I'm getting much more fluent with HTML and the web, but I feel like i'm moving too slow... 
 
 Day 8: Feb 28, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Did the MDN HTML multimedia and embeding assesement. Also read some clean code in the morning.
  - Thoughts: Glad I was able to get anything done after today's basketball game vs the students! Also, applied for a Reventure Job in Eugene... had to put my major as Education because Theology wasn't an option... 
  - Link to work: https://github.com/mckelveygreg/learning-area/blob/master/html/multimedia-and-embedding/mdn-splash-page-start/index.html
    
 Day 9: Mar 1, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Did my morning reading of Clean Code: don't leave useless comments, and make a function for everything! 
  - Thoughts: Glad I got a little coding in after music tonight. I'm pooped, I need to learn more, and I hope this all works out.... 
  
 Day 10: Mar 2, 2018
  - Today's Progess: Clean Code - Don't write dumb comments. MDN - advanced tables.zzzz 
  - Thoughts: Wish I had more time to work today... need to finish HTML...
  
 Day 11: Mar 3, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Moved on from HTML to CSS.
  - Thoughts: Tables look like a giant waste of time! There has got to be a better way. The CSS practice seems like a good idea, but really, I'm aiming to be comfortable enough to do the wiki and twitch projects! 
  
 Day 12: Mar 4, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Did a CSS Type Setting tutorial. Concepts: ems, <a> link states, colors, web fonts.

  - Thoughts: I am starting to make a social media splash :)
  
 Day 15: Mar 7, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Finished the MDN CSS Box tuts. Made a cool box and styled some letter head
  - Thoughts: applied for 2 jobs today, got a call back from a call center and hat is sorta funny :) 
  
 Day 16: Mar 8, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Read Ch. 6 in Clean Code: Objects and Data Structures. Also, had "lock-in" at school, so couldn't do anything in the evening. 
  - Thoughts: It is really hard to balance work with learning... Also, I am through 100pgs of Clean Code! 
  
 Day 17: Mar 9, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Watched some FreeCodeCamp videos about computer basics in order to get ready for CompApps class. Also, read ch. 7 in Clean Code: Error Handling.
  - Thoughts: Had to spend my evening sermon prepping, but at least I could read. I will probally have to read the whole book again, but at least I'm getting exposure?
  
 Day 18: Mar 10, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Worked on the final section for CSS on MDN: CSS Layout.
  - Thoughts: Can't wait to finally be geared up and renewed for javascript and document manipulation so I can finish my wiki-viewer and twitch page. I really want to move on with better JS, but I feel my lack of CSS and HTML understanding has been holding me back. 
  
 Day 19: Mar 11, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Finished the MDN CSS Tuts! Made a random number guessing game for MDN's first JS tut
  - Thoughts: Glad to finally be diving into JS, so I can get closer to feeling better about my front end workings
  - Link to work: https://github.com/mckelveygreg/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/first-splash/number-guessing-game-start.html
 
 Day 20: Mar 12, 2028
  - Today's Progress: Did some JS review. 
  - Thoughts: glad this JS is starting to feel relavent to my FCC challenges.
  
 Day 21: Mar 13, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Did the beginner MDN JavaScript challenges without cheating!! 
  - Thoughts: It is late, after community dinner and Jazz Anonymous Practice... I'm pooped. However, completing challenges does give me a lot of energy! 
 
 Day 22: Mar 14, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Happy PI Day. Finished MDN's first JS section complete with a silly (stupid) story generator. 
  - Thoughts: It is really easy to follow their instructions, but without their help, I slayed all of the replace() functions! 
  - Link to work: https://github.com/mckelveygreg/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/introduction-to-js-1/assessment-start/index.html
  
 Day 23: Mar 15, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Started MDN's JavaScript conditionals section. 
  - Thoughts: I hope that once I finish MDN, ill be able to make good headway on the FCC projects... 
  
  
  Day 24: Mar 16, 2018
   - Today's Progress: MDN's JS is going quick. Finished the JS building blocks section.
   - Thoughts: I had to cheat on a function return thing. Still not comfortable with that. However, the intro to events was the most helpful thing.

  Day 25: Mar 17, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finished JS objects, now just need to do the assessment. Adding more event functions to balls... 
   - Thoughts: I decided to code one more section before bed instead of another episode of Mr. Robot. I call that a win
   
  Day 26: Mar 18, 2018
    - Today's Progress: Finished the bouncing balls MDN assessment and looked into APIs.
    - Thoughts: On the last stretch before I'm back to FCC projects. These MDN tuts are nice and informative, and have great scaffolding, but the FCC tuts will be more helpful for solidifying skills and building my profile.
    Link to work: https://github.com/mckelveygreg/learning-area/tree/master/javascript/oojs/bouncing-balls
    
  Day 27: March 19, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finished MDN DOM manipulation and am getting into ajax calls.
   - Thoughts: Thought I knew enough to finally work on my wiki page project... nope! 
   
  Day 28: March 20, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finished the can-store script about fetch() and XHR client side APIs
   - Thoughts: I feel like I'm becoming more fluent in my debugging skillz, like this would have taken me a week only a month ago!
   - Link to work: https://github.com/mckelveygreg/learning-area/tree/master/javascript/apis/fetching-data/can-store

  Day 29: March 21, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Dipped into more third party api stuff with Google Maps. Also installed linux on hyper-v, effectively slowing my laptop to a halt... 
   - Thoughts: I was not as productive as I needed to be. But I am in a place where installing linux is fun, but is bad because it is a distraction! 
   
  Day 30: March 22, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finished MDN's 3rd party API tuts with the NYT archive search
   - Thoughts: uninstalled VS 2015, took forever... I need a faster computer...
   
  Day 31: March 23, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Guests came today, at least I caught 2 episodes of Crash Course Comp Science! 
   - Thoughts: I love crash course!! I stole some time during lunch to watch an episode, and have been watching every morning during breakfast :)
    
  Day 32: March 24, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finally finished the FCC Wiki viewer!
   - Thoughts: Took forever. Couldn't figure out the best API call to do, though I'm more happy with my method than any of the others I saw. Also, couldn't figure out how to make my JS objects work with flexbox! Was it applied too late in the css??

  Day 33: March 25, 2018

   - Thoughts: Canvas is not my cup of tea... for now... 
    
  Day 34: March 26, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Stumbled through MDN's JS Video API tut, and caught 1 1/2 episodes of CrashCourse CompSci
   - Thoughts: It is so much harder to stay awake only reading without coding. Need to go back and actually code that example so I can try the challenge.
    
  Day 35: March 27, 2018
   - Today's Progress: ha!! Completed the JS videoPlayer scrubber challenge on my own by getting the bounds of the timer box, the location of my click, and setting the time off of that!
   - Thoughts: Felt great to overcome a little logic challenge. It makes me feel as if I'm starting to speak the language! 
   - Link to work: https://github.com/mckelveygreg/learning-area/tree/master/javascript/apis/video-audio/start
   
  Day 36: March 28, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finished what I want from MDN, the client side storage doesn't seem relevant for the time being... time to move on to finish more FCC projects
   - Thoughts: MDN tuts are like dessert... time to go back to meat and potatoes.
   
  Day 37: March 29, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Made it half way through the twitch view app! 
   - Progress is so much faster now that I know both what I want and how to do it!
   
  Day 38: March 30, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Called a fetch API inside of another fetch API! Still need to style twitch viewer
   - Thoughts: My goal of getting better JavaScript to HTML communication is going well! Now I just need to make more and better CSS decisions... 
  
  Day 39: March 31, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Yea! Finished the twitch viewer. Jumped back into FCC JavaScript challenges
   - Thoughts: My styling is getting better. FCC challenges are super hard! Had to mildly cheat on most... 
   - Link to work: https://codepen.io/mckelveygreg/full/qooaZz/
   
  Day 40: April 1, 2018
   - Today's PRogress: Did some FCC challenges, had to cheat a bit much... Looked into the Planning Center Church directory app for OICC though
   - Thoughts: JS challenges are still above my skill! The planning center API doesn't look too difficult though!
   
  Day 41: April 2, 2018
   - Today's progress: I opened up a bazillion tabs and can't find out how to send client id and secret in a JSON header!
   - Thoughts: I twitted out for help today... i hope something comes of it!! I need to get better at asked for help, or at least finding the right spot for it!
   
  Day 42: April 7, 2018
   - Today's progress: Broke my streak, but came back to move move my profile to github. 
   - Thoughts: I think I want to move all my projects that direction and start developing there. Seems more legit...
    link to work: mckelveygreg.github.io
    
  Day 43: April 8, 2018
   - Today's progress: Almost solved the Exact-Change Challenge without cheating...
   - Thoughts: Learned how to replace a switch statement with an object, it makes way more sense to do it that way! Will implement tomorrow
    
  Day 44: April 9, 2018
   - Today's progress: I completed the exact-change project, but not on my own... 
   - Thoughts: Still waiting for the days when I'll be able to complete these things on my own!
    
  Day 45: April 10, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Cheated on the update Inventory challenge. But at least I'm getting practice with forEach() calls
   - Thoughts: I was able to spend a lot of time on this one, and almost got it... but their solutions are so good!
    
  Day 46: April 11, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Did 2 advanced JS challenges today: Heap's algorithm to solve a permutation challenge, and the bob constructor! 
   - Thoughts: I felt like I actually was able to figure everything out, but didn't have the coding vocabulary to put it down correctly

  Day 47: April 12, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finished the final advanced JS challenges, and almost by myself!
   - Thoughts: It was nice to at least get the framework of what the code was supposed to do down. But the solutions helped me piece it all together. 
  
  Day 48: April 13, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Made the button layout with CSS Grid today! But went down a rabbit hole of npm and node.js in order to attempt an install of a math equation parser... 
   
  Day 49: April 14, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finished basic node, and started the server side stuff
   - Thoughts: I really hope this turns out. I just want to be able to use node modules for my calculator! 
   
  Day 50: April 15, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Almost clicked finish on learnyounnode
   - Thoughts: It is enjoyable that I am able to figure these out by myself! 1/2 way through!!
   
  Day 51: April 16, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Had all day to finish node servers, and go slowly enough to kinda figure out what is going on! 
   - Thoughts: I still don't see how I can use this...! Where will it apply?
   
  Day 52: April 17, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Working through Expressjs. I guess it handles some of the work for me? Like a middle-man?
   - Thoughts: Got to explain what I'm doing to Lacey's grandma... perhaps I don't understand as much as i think!
   
  Day 53: April 18, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finished the calc!
   - Thoughts: took forever, and the node package helped. 
   - Link to work: https://mckelveygreg.github.io/JS-Calculator/
   
  Day 54: April 19, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finished the timer!! 
   - Thoughts: I'm getting faster at this! Now i just need to learn how to make things prettier... 
   - Link to work: https://mckelveygreg.github.io/Pomodoro-Timer/
   
  Day 55: April 20, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Started Tic Tac Toe
   - Thoughts: found a tutorial to follow!
   
  Day 56: April 21, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Hoped to finish Tic Tac Toe tut, but baby shower took all day :(
   - Thoughts: I may have bitten off more than I can chew!
   
  Day 57: April 22, 2018
   - Today's Progress: between road tripping and the dog on the ferry, I couldn't quite jam out all of the tic tac toe code...
   - Thoughts: still don't know if this will even work!
   
  Day 58: April 23, 2018
   - Today's progress: got rest of the code copied/typed, but i have no idea how to initialize anything!! 
   - Thoughts: I really want to be able to adapt what i'm working with, but this is getting ridiculous!
   
  Day 59: April 24, 2018
   - Today's progress: I'm getting flashbacks to trying to get my weather api to work... 
   - Thoughts: This tic tac toe project is starting to feel like a waste of time because I can't figure out mr. man's tut!! 
   
  Day 60: April 25, 2018
   - Today's progress: split the whole project up into different classes, like the tut suggested. What it did, is enabling me to clarify my bug! Forgot quotes... 
   - Thoughts: Made the switch to VS code yesterday, and I feel like I'm getting more comfortable in this world
   
  Day 61: April 26, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Podcast day! Thanks FreeCodeCamp Pocasts for teaching me about API's and job switching with a full time job
   - Thoughts: I'm almost to a place at work where I can start coding more...
   
  Day 62: April 27, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Another podcast day... Listened to one about negotiating salary and job offers. Super informative! 
   - Thoughts: It seems crazy to me that I may be negotiating something like this in the near future. I am intimidated, but hopefully when I'm done teaching, i'll have some time to figure it out!
   
  Day 63: April 28, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Dove back in to the planning center directory project. There is a whole template online, but I've never worked with anything like it before! 
   - Thoughts: I think it is Angular. I don't like it, it seems clunky and outdated, but I'll at least need to learn it for this project! 
   
  Day 64: April 29, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Dove back into Tic Tac Toe.
   - Thoughts: this is showing me how important it is to learn how to understand other people's code. Especially if it is way above your head!
  
  Day 65: April 30, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Only had some time for soem solo learn and to chew through more tic tac toe
   - Thoughts: I hsould have a few good days ahead of me, with less traveling. Spent all day at a work retreat...
   
  Day 66: May 1, 2018
   - Today's Progress: discovered codewars! And it is more around my level. It is nice review and I already leveled up. 
   - Thoughts: It is has been 2 months now! I'm getting more antsy to complete a real world project...
   
  Day 67: May 2, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Went for a codewars day again. 
   - Thoughts: It is hard to start and stop a project too many times without getting really frustrated...
    
  Day 68: May 3, 2018
   - Today's Progress: I'm almost Level 6 in CodeWars, still not enough time to sit down for real projects
   - Thoughts: Lacey talked to me tonight. She is scared about how little time we spend together.  I need to figure out a better balance and more intentional time! 
    
  Day 69: May 4, 2018
   - Today's Progress: My AI makes moves for tictactoe! But it is unhinged and unshackled, so it cheats like a mother... 
   - Thoughts: I need to figure out how to better handle my event handlers! 
   
  Day 70: May 5, 2018
   - Today's Progress: I finally have a mildly functioning TicTacToe that I will be walking away from... 
   - Thoughts: It sucks not to finish something all the way, but I feel like I've learned all the lessons I can
   - Link to work: https://mckelveygreg.github.io/TicTackToe/
   
  Day 71: May 6, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Started the Simon Game. First I went through a bunch of Khan trying to figure out how to draw circles/arcs. Not that hard with CSS actually. 
   - Thoughts: My design skill are still so clunky, slow, and painstaking... So much to remember, but I must get better and problem solving these things! 
   
  Day 72: May 7, 2018
   - Today's progress: Followed up on Elliot's text about triplebyte and stayed up way to late to do the multi-choice quiz section!
   - Thoughts: well i passed it... but we'll see how tomorrow's programming challenge goes..
   
  Day 73: May 8, 2018
   - Today's Progress: did the triplebyte programming challenges... 
   - Thoughts: That was a bit over my head today. I almost finished both, but I am still so young in the industry!
   
  Day 74: May 9, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Got a response back from triplebyte... Whoops.. In other news, I got my simon settings lined up, and the button sound attached!
   - Thoughts: I made objects, and did git commits for each of the change stages i did!! I'm feeling proffessional today :)
   
  Day 75: May 10, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Squeezed in a codewars challenge before bed...
   - Thoughts: I'm glad I got at least a little done... 
  
  Day 76: May 13, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Mother's Day weekend, in-laws, and preaching made me skip 2 days, but I got some headway on Simon
   - Thoughts: Software planning sucks... by sucks, i mean difficult. There must be a better way?
   
  Day 77: May 14, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Starting experimenting with setting up a dev environment for Code.org. Also, figured out how to make my JS light up and play the sounds for the simon game
   - Thoughts: I conquered a problem with intervals and got some headway on Simon!! 
   
  Day 78: May 15, 2018
   - Today's Progress: The game actually functions. starts, keeps track of things, stops, restarts. It is just super ugly and not responsive... 
   - Thoughts: It is a great feeling to have developed this mostly from the ground up! 
   
  Day 79: May 16, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Finished the Simon game at work. Styled, complete with favicons!! 
   - Thoughts: I'm so ready for some backend projects. Also, I'm getting more used to setting up dev environments.
   - Link to work: https://mckelveygreg.github.io/SimonGame/
   
  Day 80: May 17, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Collecting React Tutorials
   - Thoughts: Everyone has their own React paths... this is going to be tough
   
  Day 81: May 18, 2018
   - Today's Progress: Tried setting up a local React Dev environment...
   - Thoughts: Can't figure out how to lint react... and my dev envirnoments are panning out. Gotta keep reading things I don't understand
